To build the program type "make" on the command line.

To run the program with a file of your choice, type "./P0 yourfile" where "yourfile" is a file without the exention. ".sp18" will be added as the extension within the program. 

	This will cause the output files to have the names "yourfile.preorder" "yourfile.inorder" "yourfile.postorder"

If you have another file that you'd like to run without the extension ".sp18" then pipe it into the the program upon execution by typing the command: "./P0 < yourfile" 

	This will cause the output files to have the names: "out.preorder" "out.inorder" "out.postorder"

To clean all executables and output files, type "make clean"
